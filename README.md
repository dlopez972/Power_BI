# Power BI Tutorial 

Organizations have been leveraging Power BI over the last few years, and it's adoption is on the rise. The intent of this repository is to help train users on the tool broken down into four different stages. 

- Gather data: 
    how a user would get data into Power BI desktop & service. 
- Transform data: 
    how a user would leverage Power BIs Power Query to clean and transform their data. 
- Model data: 
    using Power BI desktop in order to build out a more dynamic model for reporting & analytical needs. 
- Visualize data: 
    using Power BI desktop to build out a visualization on top of the data model built in the previous stage. 


Each stage will have it's own steps needed to be performed, but the combine stages are nothing more than a process that helps frame common data challenges in a methodical manner.
